# Warm Up

- We are going to publish the page to the web shortly with github pages. Your mission is to personalize this profile page by doing the following:

CONTENT CHANGES IN INDEX.HTML

- Changing the page title to your name (or a title of your choosing)
- Changing the content of the h1 to match your name
- Changing the content of the p to match a description or phrase or motto
- Changing the Facebook, Twitter, Github links to point to your own page- (If you don't have a twitter delete that link). Hint: You will have to change the href attribute value to change where the link points. If you have other links you can add those.

STYLE / APPEARANCE CHANGES IN STYLE.CSS

Changing the colors scheme of the page to something you personally like. Go to Coolers (https://coolors.co/browser/best/1) and pick out a color scheme that you like.

We can select an element with it's `class` attribute using a `.` before the class name.

so we would select the HTML element

`<a class="profile-link">`

in our CSS with

`.profile-link { * styles here * }`

Change the following elements' colors:

- body: BACKGROUND COLOR
- .profile-link: COLOR
- a:hover, a:visited:hover : COLOR
- a:visited COLOR
- .square-one .inner COLOR
- .square-two .inner COLOR
- .square-three .inner COLOR

Bonus1: Find a different font on google fonts and change the appearance of text on this page

Bonus2: Find a way to have the email link open gmail with an email open to yourself

Bonus3: Further adjust the styling and content of the page as your heart desires.
